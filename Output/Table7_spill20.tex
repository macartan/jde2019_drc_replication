 \begin{flushleft}\textit{Notes:} 
  Spillover effects estimated using a regression model of the form $Y = \alpha Direct + \beta Indirect + \gamma Direct \times
  Indirect$ where both the  direct and indirect maesures are normalized to have zero means. Average
  direct and indirect effects are then given by $\alpha$ and $\beta$. 
  RMSE is used as a test statistic for the randomization infernence and the $p$ value reports the probability of such a low RMSE under the sharp null of no effects. \end{flushleft}
