 \begin{flushleft}\textit{Notes:} For ``Embezzlement (list experiment)'' and ``Dominance of Chief's Preferences'' we estimate equation (2), 
  and report estimates for $\beta_2$ in the Control column and estimates for $\beta_3$ in the Effect column, where \textit{X} is the sensitive 
  item and the chief, respectively. All analyses employ inverse propensity weights, clustering of standard errors at the level 
  of randomization clusters, and block fixed effects. Cluster column refers to the number of unique village clusters.
