An update on the first version:

Updates made:
- improvements to some variables: da000_name_chefferie, qr001, b_23
- treatment identifiers (Tuungane, Rapid, and those related to the survey experiments) made available

FYI:
- updated datasets end with "_v2"
- "DRC2012_Instruments.pdf", "DRC2012_Overview_Label.xlsx", "DRC2012_Overview_Weights.xlsx" were not updated

- Version 2 includes 3 additional datasets:

"IRC_tracking_v2.dta"
- Information about all 1,250 Tuungane treatment villages (so-called VDCs)
- Obtained from the IRC in 2010

"Lottery_v2.dta"
- 2006/2007 data on CDC level lottery: into Tuungane treatment, and into gender parity treatment
- for 630 CDCs, grouped into 83 lottery bins

This is data used for a set of research projects.
It is in a raw state, corrected versions may be posted at a later date.
The PIs can only provide limited support to users.

Information related to 2012 data collected in Eastern Congo
Collected in 2012 in the provinces: South Kivu, Haut Katanga, Tanganyika, Maniema

"DRC2012_Instruments.pdf"
- Document contains all instruments
- All variables in the datasets have informative labels that relate to this document

********************************************************

DATASETS:

All variables are labeled, where the first word indicates the survey model from where the data originated. 
See "DRC2012_Overview_Label.xls" for more info

"DRC2012_Overview_Weights.xls" gives an overview of the different sampling weights used for this study

Variables that are the same across the datasets:
- IDV: is the village ID
- IDS: is the survey ID
- IDO: is the ID for next lower level unit (e.g. unique code for different fields)

Generic codes across the datasets:
- "-9" is don't know
- "-8" is not applicable
- "-7" is refused to respond
		
Related to the datasets, the letters after "DRC2012" indicate during what step(s) the data was collected
Data was collected in two different types of villages: RAPID villages and survey-only villages
RAPID villages received a $1,000 unconditional cash transfer. These villages were visited 4 times: A-D
Survey-only villages were visited only once. During Step D.

"A_DISC.dta" 
- All discussion interventions during the village assembly during Step A
- for the 560 RAPID villages only
- 7,761 observations. Level is intervention
- IDO indicates intervention
- All unique interventions, but note that (IDV IDO) is not unique

"D_AUDIT.dta" 
- Information from the audit that was conducted
- for 560 RAPID villages
- level at the village

"D_ROSTER.dta"
- Information about all individuals in the household
- for 1,120 villages and 10,640 households
- 47,369 observations

"ABD_VILL.dta"
- for 1,120 villages
- Has the village level data

"ABD_INDIV.dta"
- Has lots of different types of respondents: 5 HHs, 3 most influential during step A, 1 chef, etc.
- for 1,120 villages and 10,640 households
- 10,640 observations

Note that due to security reasons, etc. not all 1,120 villages were visited and not all 10,640 individuals were interviewed.

********************************************************

We left out some data purposefully: 
- Anything that can identify the household or the individual (names, phonenumbers, households' GPS location, etc.)
- Variables that are treatment variations for which we hope to write future academic papers.
